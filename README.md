# Zig language package

Syntax highlighting for the Zig programming language.  (also supports .zon).

A continuation of [language-zig-treesitter](https://github.com/GrayJack/language-zig),
updated for Pulsar and the most recent version of Zig.

## Usage

Simply open any ``.zig`` or ``.zon`` file in pulsar after installing the package

## I prefer the older version of this package!  How do I get it?

This package recently just got a major update- and a lot of how the highlighting
looks may have changed.  If you prefer the previous style of highlighting you run
the following command:
```sh
ppm install language-zig@v0.5.3
```
